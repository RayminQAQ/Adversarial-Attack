# Adversarial-Attack
This project focuses on the development and analysis of Poison Attack and Evasion Attack strategies, crucial tools for understanding and enhancing the robustness of neural networks against adversarial threats.

## Project Structure

```
Repository file structure:
    |-- Basic_pipline.py
    |-- Poison_Attack.py
    |-- Envasion_Attack.py
    |-- model.py
    |-- utils.py
    |-- README.md
```

## Pipeline
There are three piplines can use for machine learning training and testing:
1. **Basic_pipline.py**: Basic model without adding any Adversarial-Attack method.
2. **Poison_Attack.py**: Based on Basic_pipline and add Poison Attack measure.
3. **Envasion_Attack.py**: Based on Basic_pipline and add Envasion Attack measure.
